The trend in special educational assessment and programming has changed from IQ based grouping to functional level based grouping without compromising on age appropriate programming. 
Any educational assessment tool should ideally lead to appropriate programming for the child. 
It should also provide inbuilt periodic evaluation facility for monitoring progress and modifying programme. 
The tool also should provide for qualitative and quantitative measurement of the child's progress.
